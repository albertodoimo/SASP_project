# SASP_project

This project about non linear distortion is part of the SASP course inside the MSc in Music and Acoustic Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. It is composed of simple code along with a didactic application that uses an in-built **MATLAB application**.

**Non linear distortion** uses **Wavetable synthesis** to create signals and then develops **Waveshaping** and **Phase Distortion** tecniques. 

A short [presentation](./SASP_project/NL_distortion_slides.pdf) shows the principles and a the characteristics of this project.
